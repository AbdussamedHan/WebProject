                <br>
                I completed a mini project for my Procedural Programming module in my first semester which was a board 
                game which had secret and trap positions which either gave extra points or deducted points respectfully. 
                This project made me utilise many bits of knowledge I had previously such as searching and sorting 
                algorithms from my A-Level computer science course in Python. I also brushed up on my procedural 
                programming style of writing programs with the help of this module. However, something that was new to 
                me was using Java itself as I had no prior experience but this was easily overcome with a bit of 
                practice tasks.

                I also completed a coursework for my Computer Systems and Networks module where I had to code in MIPS 
                assembly language. This was very challenging as I only had experience in high-level programming 
                languages and had never actually coded using assembly languages before, I had only learnt about registers 
                using LMC. Nonetheless, I completed the coursework
